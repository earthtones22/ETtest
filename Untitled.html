		<div>Miss Expanding Universe Syllabus
Uncreative writing. Non-editing. The Art of copying. Found poetry. Primal authenticity. Vexxed queerness. Imperfectionism. Life as collage. Uncomfortable conversations as research. Question your identity. Lose track of yourself. Crack the husks of habit. Learn to poop without your phone. Fight to keep yourself engaged with other humans. Break things. Allow your brain to be broken. Unlearn something. Experience cow-like bliss. Experience the serenity of madness. Celebrate amateurism. Insist on the process of becoming. Retire the word “work.” Aesthetics as aisthesis. Practice being unlikable. Exhale.
